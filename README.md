# Detecting cars on images (JPEG)  

---

Example app showing cars (*cars, trucks and buses*) detection on jpeg images.  
It uses standard **resnet50_fpn** model from **torchvision** library of **PyTorch**.
It could be deployed with Docker file but this will work when container is started with root privileges.

When You start Docker container without root privileges see *mogenius* branch of this repository which is version of this app for such a case.

Working example of this app could be seen at:
